# Walky-Talky-Two-Raspberry-Pi-s-
Call to another Raspberry Pi computer at it's IP address. It is basically an audio spy.

If you are a spy or work for the ISI or the RAW, this will come in handy in your knowledge. Given the size and price of the Raspberry Pi, it occurred to me that using it as a spying device (which are actually really expensive) would be really appropriate. In this case, Iâ€™ll explain how to convert your Raspberry Pi into an audio streaming device, or audio spying device, however suits best to you. Use it under your own responsibility.
